## ðŸš€ Why Turbo Charge?

- **Production-ready out of the box**
- **Stable, tested stack** â€” no fragile boilerplate
- **Fast setup** â€” clone, install, and you're live
- **Built by humans, not generated by AI** â€” every line reviewed, refined, and documented
- **Community support via Discord**

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started)
- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli?install-method=homebrew)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Reposible-tc/turbo-charge.git
   cd turbo-charge
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Environment Variables

1. Create a .env file in the project root.

2. Copy the example:

```bash
cp .example.env .env
```

3. Fill in the required variables in .env
   > If you already know where to find all the environment variables, go ahead and populate them. Otherwise, don't worry â€” the setup guides below (e.g., for Supabase, Stripe, Sentry, Resend) explain exactly where to obtain each one.

## Supabase Setup

Instructions for working with Supabase in local and remote development.

### Generating Supabase Types

Keep your TypeScript types in sync with your database schema:

```bash
# For a local Supabase instance
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > ./src/lib/supabase/types.ts

# For a remote Supabase project
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> > ./src/lib/supabase/types.ts
```

These commands generate types.ts under src/lib/supabase/types.ts based on your schema.

### Database Migrations & Deployment

1. Link Your Supabase Project

```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
```

2. Pull Remote Schema Changes (if any)

```bash
npx supabase db pull --schema auth,storage
```

Review the generated migration file in supabase/migrations/.

3. Create a New Migration

```bash
npx supabase db diff --file <NAME_OF_MIGRATION>
```

Tip: Review and test all migrations carefully before pushing to production.
Refer to the Supabase CLI documentation for advanced usage.

4. Apply & Reset Migrations Locally

```bash
# Apply migrations
npx supabase migration up

# (Optional) Reset local database
npx supabase db reset
```

5. Deploy to Remote

```bash
npx supabase db push
```

This will deploy your local migrations to the remote Supabase instance, keeping both environments in sync.

## Stripe Setup

First, create a [Stripe account](https://stripe.com) if you haven't already. Once your account is ready, switch to **Test Mode** and start a local webhook listener by running the following command:

```bash
stripe login

stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

This webhook endpoint is configured to listen to the following Stripe events (feel free to add or remove events as needed):

- `product.created`
- `product.updated`
- `product.deleted`
- `price.created`
- `price.updated`
- `price.deleted`
- `checkout.session.completed`
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`

These events help keep your Stripe data in sync with your Supabase database.

### Products and Prices

When you create, update, or delete a product or price in the Stripe dashboard, the same change will be reflected in your database automatically.

### Subscriptions and Checkout Sessions

When a `checkout.session.completed` event is received, the webhook determines whether the session was for a **subscription** or a **one-time payment**:

- For **subscription-based sessions**, it creates a corresponding subscription record in your database, including details like the customer ID, plan, and status.
- For **one-time payments**, it logs the successful transaction along with relevant metadata such as the customer and product information.

### Customer Subscription Sync

To ensure your database always has up-to-date information about your customersâ€™ subscriptions, the webhook also listens to subscription-related events:

- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`

These events allow you to track changes such as new subscriptions, plan changes, cancellations, and status updates. Every time a customer's subscription is modified in Stripe, the corresponding data is automatically updated in your Supabase database.

## Sentry Setup

To enable error tracking and performance monitoring in your application, [create a Sentry account](https://sentry.io/signup) and set up a new **Next.js** project.

### Configuration

1. **Set the DSN**
   Add your Sentry DSN to the `.env` file:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your-dsn-here
   ```

2. **Update the `package.json` scripts**
   Modify your `package.json` to include the `sentry:sourcemaps` script and chain it to the `build` script:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "next build && npm run sentry:sourcemaps",
     "sentry:sourcemaps": "sentry-cli sourcemaps inject --org <YOUR-ORGANIZATION-NAME> --project <YOUR-PROJECT-NAME> ./.next && sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --org <YOUR-ORGANIZATION-NAME> --project <YOUR-PROJECT-NAME> ./.next"
   }
   ```

   Be sure to replace `<YOUR-ORGANIZATION-NAME>` and `<YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>` with the correct values from your Sentry account.

### Notes

- Running `npm run build` will now automatically inject and upload source maps to Sentry.
- This ensures better error stack traces by mapping minified production code back to your original source code.
- You may need to configure `sentry-cli` with an auth token. Refer to the [Sentry CLI documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/configuration/#auth-tokens) for setup instructions.

## Resend Setup

Resend provides a simple and reliable email API for sending transactional emails in your app.

### Add API Key

Get your API key from [resend.com](https://resend.com) and add it to your `.env` file:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

### Notes

- You can customize the sender domain (`noreply@yourdomain.com`) by verifying a domain in the Resend dashboard.
- Resend supports rich HTML, dynamic templates, and unsubscribe management.

## Running the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
